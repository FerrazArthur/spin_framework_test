## Configuration

### Install spin

You can install spin version 1.5.1 with the command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://developer.fermyon.com/downloads/install.sh | bash -s -- -v v1.5.1 | sudo mv spin /usr/bin
```

### Docker configuration

<details>
<summary> Docker desktop engine </summary>

#### Docker Desktop Engine

To run the containers using docker-desktop engine, follow the steps bellow.

Wasm workloads require the containerd image store feature to be turned on. If youâ€™re not already using the containerd image store, then pre-existing images and containers will be inaccessible.

In order to enable containerd image store in docker desktop, follow the instructions bellow.  

- Open the Docker Desktop Settings;
- Go to Features in development and then select the Beta features tab;
- Check the following checkboxes:
  - Use containerd for storing and pulling images;
  - Enable Wasm.
- Select Apply & restart to save the settings;
- In the confirmation dialog, select Install to install the Wasm runtimes.

Docker Desktop downloads and installs the following runtimes that you can use to run Wasm workloads:

- io.containerd.slight.v1
- io.containerd.spin.v1
- io.containerd.wasmedge.v1
- io.containerd.wasmtime.v1

<summary> Docker Engine 24.0.6</summary>

#### Docker Engine 24.0.6

To run the containers using docker engine, follow the steps bellow: (wasi-wasm containerd shims wasnt supported by the time i wrote this)

Go to file /etc/docker/daemon.json and add this inside it's command block:

```bash
  "features": {
    "containerd-snapshotter": true
  }
```

> You need to add a "," in the end of the line before "features" line.

If that file doest exists, then you create it and paste inside:

```bash
{
  "features": {
    "containerd-snapshotter": true
  }
}
```

Then you want to restart docker.service with command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker.service
```

## Run

### Run spin server

To run a spin container, use the following command

```docker container run --name=spin-example -p 3000:80 -v ./volume-log:/log -i --runtime io.containerd.spin.v1 ghcr.io/ferrazarthur/spin_framework_test:latest up --log-dir /log```

In order to test it:  
```curl http://localhost:3000/hello```

And also:  
```curl -d "echo this: hello wasm!" http://localhost:3000/echo```
